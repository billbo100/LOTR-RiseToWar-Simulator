# LOTR-RiseToWar-Simulator
The Goal of this Project is to create an accurate Battle Simulator to test different builds.

I aim to organize it in such a way that is easily extendable for new commanders, units, Skills, etc

Current Plan:
Create extendable Effects that include most any action that can be taken in the game
Combine those into skills (some skills have more than 1 effect. all title skills for example)
